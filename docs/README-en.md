# SmooScroll*

**Smooth Scrolling JS base on native scrollbar**

*平滑滚动页面 / Smooth your scroll*

**alpha version, still in development*
</div>

SmooScroll is a smooth scrolling JS for static HTML web pages, based on native JavaScript so it doesn't require any dependencies (such as jQuery, Vue, etc.).
The effect of SmooScroll is based on native scrollbar and win't block the default scrollbar or creating a fake scrollbar.
#### Visit[sample web page](https://shuninyu.github.io/SmooScroll/)

⚠️*SmooScroll is currently an early version，so it is not perfect yet.*

### Why SmooScroll？
Maybe you already know some similar smooth scrolling JS like[Lenis](https://github.com/darkroomengineering/lenis)or[GSAP ScrollSmoother](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollSmoother/).

Unlike Lenis, SmooScroll' s smooth scrolling effect doesn't directly affect your scrollbar. The most intuitive difference is that when pressing keyboard arrow keys or dragging scrollbar, the webpage will still scroll smoothly, rather than being directly bounding to scrollbar's movement, the effect is more similar to ScrollSmoother.
Besides, ScrollSmoother is a paying customer only plugin, it needs a **150USD** /year subscription to get access of the plugin. If there is only a smooth scrolling effect needed, then this pricing is a little bit high cost for individual developer or amateur.

So, if the only need is to add a smooth scrolling effect to the entire webpage, SmooScroll would be a good choice.(after I fix the bug of course :P）
But if you don't need the smooth scrolling effect when dragging scrollbar or pressing kerboard arrow keys, then using Lenis is enough.

### Current issues
由于本人并不是专业前端，对于JavaScript掌握较浅，所以SmooScroll目前还有一些问题。
Since I'm not a professional front-end developer and have a shallow grasp of JavaScript, SmooScroll currently has some problems.
#### bug
⚠️Currently, if a large height value is defined inside the scroll-container, it will cause scrollbar errors. Specifically, the scrollbar position does not match the page position and scrolling over-limit. For example, when you only drag the scrollbar halfway, the page has already scrolled to the bottom, and you can still scroll the page. Usually this will cause a blank area at the bottom of the page that should not exist, and the higher the height value of the element, the larger of ​​the blank area. This problem is only triggered by height, and neither margin nor padding will trigger this problem.

🔎Based on observation, it can be determined that this is a problem of scrolling distance. When the page is actually scrolled down 84px, the transform.translate value in smoothContent is -42px, when it is actually scrolled down 200px, this value is -100px, which is obviously inconsistent with the actual scrolling distance. So when the page has scrolled to the bottom, the scroll bar has not actually reached the bottom and can still scrolling down. Then when you scroll down further, the displayed area will be just a space with nothing in it.

💉The current temporary solution is to avoid defining a height value too high, including SmooScroll containers.

If you need more blank space(or just space for relative/absolute layout) in the webpage, you can use an empty div with a larger margin value to create the space for the page.
